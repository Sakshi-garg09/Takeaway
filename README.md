# App     : Lieferando 

# Feature : Payment Gateway testing

# Document with test scenarios and test cases : PaymentTest.Feature


# Why you decided to write the test cases the way you did

I have been working on "*.feature" format for last 6 months and i am quite comfortable with it. I find it more manageable and easy to use.


# If there are other alternatives for writing your scenarios.

There are two other formats which i have uploaded in repository : 

1. Template 1.xlsx
2. Template 2.xlsx

I was using these formats before i started to use "*.Feature" format.


# How will this change if we tell you that our test automation engineer uses the cucumber framework to write tests

"*.feature" format will work with cucumber framework so i will continue with same format. 


# Finally, any extra information you could give us about the feature(s) you chose regarding quality (open to interpretation)

There are couple of things we should consider :

1. Credit card details - session time out : If user is taking more than "x" amount of time (5 mins), there should be a pop-up for session time out/expired.

2. I would prefer if there are two seperate pages for customer's details and payment options rather then having all these information (Address, contact number, preferred delivery time, payment option ) on one page.
